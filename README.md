# Instacart_Python_CF

## Project Summary
This repository contains initial data and exploratory analysis of Instacart's sales data, focused on revealing customer purchasing habits. As an analyst for Instacart, an online grocer, the goal is to develop customer profiles to use in marketing. This analysis seeks to form these profiles by answering questions such as: what is the busiest day, what is the busiest time, what departments are most popular, and what are the demographics for customers. These insights help Instacart tailor its marketing campaigns to effectively target the right customers, optimizing sales.

## Key Questions 
● What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?

● What departments have the highest frequency of product orders?

● What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., howoften do they return to Instacart)?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

● Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

● What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

● What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
